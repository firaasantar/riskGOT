                <p>
                    Welcome to the treacherous battlefields of Westeros, where cunning strategies and calculated alliances will determine
                    the fate of the Seven Kingdoms. In this epic game of Risk: Game of Thrones World at War, seven noble houses will clash
                    in a quest for dominance and control. As a wise player, your objective is simple yet challenging: conquer vast 
                    territories, amass valuable points, and emerge victorious as the ruler of the realm. But remember, in this game, power
                    comes at a price, and even the mightiest can fall. Safeguard your capital, for its loss could spell doom. Rally your 
                    forces, forge alliances, and let the war for the Iron Throne begin!
                </p>
                <h2>Turn Order</h2>
                <p>

                    The house you shall lead into battle will be determined by the roll of a dice, where the highest roll earns the privilege 
                    of their preferred house. Once the houses are chosen, the turn order follows a fixed sequence: Stark, Targaryen, Baratheon, 
                    Lannister, Ghiscari, Tyrell, and Martell. With your house secured and the turn order set, strategic mastery and cunning 
                    alliances will be your greatest assets as you navigate the perilous game board.
